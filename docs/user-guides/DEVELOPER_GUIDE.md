## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **General Questions**

**Q: How long does admin review take?**
A: Typically 24-48 hours for standard requests. High-priority or complex deployments may take longer.

**Q: Can I edit a request after submission?**
A: Once submitted, only admins can modify requests. You can add comments or create a new version.

**Q: Why can't I see RLM IDs?**
A: RLM IDs are administrative identifiers set by admins for integration with external change management systems. They're not needed for your workflow.

**Q: What happens if my deployment fails?**
A: Failed deployments trigger automatic rollback procedures. You'll be notified and can work with the admin to resolve issues.

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: What file formats are supported for uploads?**
A: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, ZIP, TAR, JAR, WAR, and common image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF).

**Q: Is there a file size limit for uploads?**
A: Yes, individual files are limited to 100MB. For larger files, use file sharing services and include links.

**Q: How do I handle database migrations?**
A: Include migration scripts as attachments and document the exact process in your deployment plan.

**Q: Can I schedule deployments for specific times?**
A: Yes, you can specify preferred times, but final scheduling is coordinated with admins and operations teams.

### **Process Questions**

**Q: What's the difference between "Ready for Performance" and "Ready for Production"?**
A: These are admin-controlled statuses. "Ready for Performance" means code review and initial testing are complete. "Ready for Production" means performance testing has passed and it's approved for live deployment.

**Q: How do I handle emergency deployments?**
A: Mark priority as "Critical" and follow your organization's emergency deployment procedures. Contact admins directly for expedited review.

**Q: What if I need to deploy outside business hours?**
A: Include this in your scheduling requirements. After-hours deployments may require additional approvals and on-call support.

**Q: How do I coordinate with other teams?**
A: Use the comments section to communicate with admins who can coordinate with other teams, or use your organization's standard communication channels.
